Compressing Strings
-- Take a string with repeated characters and compress them
-- use a number to show how many times it was repeated.
-- example:  aaa should be returned as 3a.

input: "aaabccdddda"
output: "3ab2c4da"

Output indicates we are ONLY adding repeats, meaning once a character stops repeating we do not add subsequent re-occurances


function stringCompression (str) {
  let output = '';
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    count++;
    if (str[i] != str[i + 1]) {
      output += count + str[i];
      count = 0;
    }
  }
  return output;
}

stringCompression("aaabccdddda")

if (count > 1) {
  output += count + str[i];
  count = 0;
} else {
  output += str[i];
